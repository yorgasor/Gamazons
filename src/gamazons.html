<h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
An amazon moves in a straight line in any direction, just like a chess queen.  
When an amazon moves to a new spot, she's required to fire an "arrow", which 
again travels in a straight line in any direction.  The square the arrow lands 
on becomes an impenetrable wall, which neither amazons nor arrows can move 
over or land on.  You also can't move or fire over other amazon pieces.  
<p>
Game play alternates turns, starting with the white player.  Each turn an 
amazon moves and fires an arrow, thus each turn another square becomes unusable.
The winner is the side that moves last.

<h2>Strategies</h2>
One way to judge a good move or position is by determining the number of 
squares you can move to vs the number your opponent can move to.  You can 
exert good control over your opponent by limiting his options.  The bad news 
is, the computer can calculate this a lot faster and more accurately than you 
can.  If this is your only strategy, you're going to get wupped.  
<p>
I've had good success by starting out with a full out attack on one amazon and
then working on positioning the rest in good locations.  Try not to put your
amazons too close to each other, try and move them to separate places so they
own different squares.
<p>
The computer AI is a pretty decent player.  It has a decent board evaluator,
but since there are so many different options to evaluate, it can't look very
far ahead until late in the game.  It also can't plan strategies, like, "Ok,
I'm going to try and claim this area for myself, so I'll block this guy here and
then block that guy over there..."  You can.  Use it to your advantage.

<h2>What the Buttons Do</h2>
<b>UNDO</b>
<br>
<blockquote>
	Sometimes you may accidentally drop a piece in a spot you didn't mean
	to.  It's especially touchy on laptop touchpads if you're not familiar
	with them.  If you've made an accident like this, you're in luck.  Just
	click on Undo and your amazon will move back.  If, however, you fired
	your arrow, you're out of luck.  Once you've done that, the turn is
	officially over and there's no going back (at least for now.  If I hear
	from enough whiners^H^H^H^H^H^users who feel this would be a useful
	feature, I'll raise the priority of multiple undo.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>FORCE MOVE</b>
<br>
<blockquote>
	Ok, it seemed like a good idea when i first designed the game, but it's
	probably not all that useful right now.  It's designed for the impatient
	user who gets tired of waiting for the AI to move.  Right now, you can
	specify the maximum time for the AI to think each turn, so if you don't
	like waiting, just set that to a low value.  Eventually I'd like to give
	the AI a variable time limit, perhaps within an overal set game time
	(ie - it has 5 minutes to play its entire game, so budget that time as
	best as possible).  Then this button <i>might</i> come in handy if it
	gets stuck on one move too long and you get impatient.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>AUTO FINISH</b>
<br>
<blockquote>
	Ah, one of the most annoying parts about Amazons in general is finishing
	the game.  Once you get to the point where all the pieces are in their
	own little areas, the game is pretty much decided.  It's just tedious
	filling in the squares until one side runs out.  This button is meant to
	remove this boredom.  Technically, all it does is set both sides to AI 
	with only 1 second to think.  Generally, filling in squares is pretty
	brainless stuff.  The only problem is, it doesn't always find the
	optimal fillin method.  It's entirely possible (and in weird complicated
	areas, likely) that it will seal off squares you could've used.  If
	you've got a close game, you could lose because of such an error.
	Eventually, I'll fix this to fill in the squares perfectly.  But for
	now, use at your own risk.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>REPLAY</b>
<br>
<blockquote>
	This button will allow you to load a saved history file, and will let you
	watch a game that the history file describes.  In theory, you should be
	able to load games from major tournaments, and be able to watch them in 
	Gamazons.  Minor massaging of their notation might be necessary for Gamazons
	to recognize it though.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>STOP</b>
<br>
<blockquote>
	This will stop a running replay of a game.  This will allow you to go back to
	a game that might have turned out differently if you did something else.  
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>REPLAY DELAY</b>
<br>
<blockquote>
	This sets the delay between moves in a game being replayed.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>MOVEMENT SPEED</b>
<br>
<blockquote>
	This sets how fast the pieces slide across the board.  For slower machines, the
	sliding might be painfully slow.  Incrementing this value may make it more 
	tolerable.
</blockquote>

<h2>Settings Menu</h2>

<b>PLAYER</b>
<br>
<blockquote>
	Here you have the ability to choose whether a side should be a human or
	AI.  You can also set some strange settings for how the AI works: how
	long he thinks, how far ahead he should look, and how many options he
	should evaluate.  Really, all you need to worry about is how long you
	want the AI to think.  However, if you really want to see how the other
	setting affect its gameplay, here's what they mean.
	<p>
	The AI works by generating a search tree out of all the possible moves
	it can make.  First, it gives evaluates all of the moves it can make
	this turn.  Then it sorts them in a line, best move first, worst move
	last.  Then it looks at what its best move and what kind of moves its 
	opponent can make in response.  Then the second best move, etc... all
	the way down the line.  A move's true value is not based solely on the
	your move, but also what kind of move your opponent can do in response. 
	<p>
	The max search depth means how far deep it will look (ie - moves it 
	can make, then moves its opponent can make, then moves it can make 
	from there ...).  
	<p>
	The search width specifies how far down the line it will look evaluate
	response values for.  For instance, if there are 3000 possible opening
	moves, what are the odds that the absolute worst opening move will 
	really turn out to be the best?  Some theories say it's best to 
	evaluate all possible moves just to make sure there's not some trap in 
	ignoring something further down.  So the default search width is 3000.
	However, by evaluating the response of fewer moves, say 15-50 you reduce
	the amount of work done at each level of the tree, thus you can see much
	further ahead.  Obviously, there's a balance to be made.  And the
	options exist so one can research the trade offs between searching wide
	vs searching deep.
	<p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>THEME</b>
<br>
<blockquote>
	Now you can select from a variety of themes that show give your gameboard 
	a different appearance.  The theme files are very simple and just
	contain the type of image and its location.  If you're feeling creative,
	go ahead and experiement with your own themes.  If it looks halfway
	decent, send it to me and I'll probably include it in the next release.
	Note: Square images are 40x40 pixels, and the game pieces should fit
	within that size.
 </blockquote>
<p>
<a NAME="future"></a>
<b>FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS</b>
<br>
<blockquote>
	Soon you will see different difficulty
	levels for the AI.  If you're new to the game and sick and tired of
	getting your can kicked every time, you'll be able to choose between
	several levels of difficulty (I'll even throw in a level that plays
	completely random so there's almost no way you could lose.  Speaking of
	which, remind me to add a feature that will detect if someone loses
	against a random AI and have it email me the loser's name & email so I
	can come back and taunt him).  I would also like to break the AI up into
	two different parts.  So you could have black at level 9 with a
	high max depth & high max width search play against white at level 6
	with a low max depth & max width search.  It's really hard for me to
	tell if a new heuristic is an improvement unless I can play it against
	the old version, so I'm not even going to try to make a smarter AI until
	these features are in.
